# 🎨 Real-Time Color Detection using OpenCV

A real-time **Computer Vision** project that detects **Blue** and **Green** colored objects from a live webcam feed and highlights them with bounding boxes using the **HSV color space**.  
This approach is robust to lighting variations and works efficiently without using any ML model.
