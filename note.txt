1.access the webcam
2. change webcam to hsv color 
3.create a mask using inrange()  (detect white as object)
4.draw boundy box using pillow library



doubt

1.why it is better to use hsv?

HSV separates color from lighting, which makes color detection more stable and accurate than RGB/BGR.

when we use RGB

Red object in sunlight → (0,0,255)
Same red object in shadow → (20,20,180)

So a simple threshold fails ❌

2.what the pillow library does in this?

Pillow is used mainly for clean visualization and annotation, not for detection itself.
